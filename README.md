ðŸ“Œ How to Write Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable Code

I keep my code clean by using clear variable names, modular functions, and comments. The CRUD Python module from Project One made it easier to connect the dashboard to MongoDB in Project Two, saving time and making the code reusable.

ðŸ›  Problem-Solving Approach as a Computer Scientist

I break problems into steps, define requirements, and plan before coding. For Project Two, I structured the database and dashboard to match user needs. This project was more real-world focused compared to past assignments, and I plan to keep using structured problem-solving in the future.

ðŸ’¡ The Role of Computer Scientists and Why It Matters

Computer scientists build software to solve problems. This project helps Grazioso Salvare quickly find rescue dogs by organizing and visualizing shelter data. Well-designed software improves efficiency, automates tasks, and enhances decision-making.
